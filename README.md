# MAPSS_Thesis
UChicago MAPSS Thesis Code

This is a repository for the code that I wrote for my MA Thesis at the University of Chicago as part of the MAPSS program

The attached Jupyter notebooks contain code and explanations, as well as all of the data and analysis that did not make it into my thesis

One notebook covers preprocessing, NLP, and Dynamic Topic Modelling, and the other covers a basic Word Frequency Analysis
